Target Platform: Windows NT 3.1 / Windows Chicago / Win32s

- Add functionality to the dialogs
- Limit to 16 colors of tiles - there will be a table of 16 brushes for each
- User input
- rand()

I'm thinking about how I'll represent the different tetris pieces
their orientations, collisions, appearances
I'm also being very careful about clipping
basically I'll have a function that draws the current shape using a brush you pass in
when there's a WM_PAINT message, it first draws the playfield then draws the shape
when the game is ticked, it first draws the shape with a black brush, then moves it, then redraws it with the appropriate brush
and all of this is done into the Compatible DC
when the game is ticked, however, it has to manually calculate and redraw the bad regions on the window
